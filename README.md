# circle_simulation
The objectif of this program it's learn how to make basic collision beetween circle and upgrade my knowledge of pygame library. In this program the numbers of circle change during the simulation. We can slow the animation with the left arrow and accelerate with the right arrow. They have five velocity (*0.25, *0.50, *1, *2 and *4) when the velocity is *1 and space was pressed the simulation was break and for restart press space again. When a circle touch an other the radius of the circle was more small and after they dispawn.
